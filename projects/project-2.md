A schoolar project was a 6 DOF robotic arm. The project was only about the building, so the design was ommited and instead we took a design from Github, which is a 3d printed bot.

As part of the class (industrial robotics), we computed the forward and inverse kinematics while we proceeded with 3d printing of the pieces for the robot and acquirement for the non-printable parts.

The Software-side in this robot was developed using Matlab and LabVIEW, and for this project we only reached the forward and inverse kinematics movements until the close of the class, leaving for the future class attenders the development of further algorithms because the robot is a donation to our school and its students.

Finally, some videos of the robot can be found in the following links:
